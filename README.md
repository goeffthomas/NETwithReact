# NETwithReact
VERY basic integration of .NET with React in the same VS Web App

## Steps to run
1. Open Command Prompt and navigate to C:
1. Run the following command: git clone https://github.com/goeffthomas/NETwithReact.git
1. Open the VS Solution (may need to wait for npm packages to install--also needed to close/reopen solution)
1. Click the Start button (Play button) for the solution
1. Navigate to http://localhost:58044/home/react
1. May take time to build, but should see "page loaded" in console followed by the response from ValuesController in console and on DOM
